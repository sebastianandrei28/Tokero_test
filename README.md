# QA Report for Tokero Testing

## Overview of the Testing

The testing suite for Tokero includes three primary test specifications: createAccount.spec.ts, footerLinkCheck.spec.ts, and loginAccount.spec.ts. These test files cover critical functionalities of the Tokero platform, ensuring that key user flows and UI elements work as expected.

1. createAccount.spec.ts
   Purpose: Validates the user registration flow.
   Key Tests:
   Verifies that the "Create Account" button redirects to the registration page.
   Ensures all required fields (email, password, confirm password, terms and conditions) are visible and functional.
   Checks that the user can successfully fill out the registration form.
   Captures screenshots of specific elements for visual validation.
   Limitations:
   The registration button click is disabled due to CAPTCHA, so the test does not validate the full registration flow (e.g., redirection to the "unconfirmed email" page).
2. footerLinkCheck.spec.ts
   Purpose: Validates the functionality of footer links across different languages and configurations.
   Key Tests:
   Dynamically validates footer links against a database or a predefined list.
   Ensures that each link navigates to the correct page and that the page loads successfully.
   Checks for valid HTTP responses (status < 400) for each link.
   Limitations:
   Timeout issues may occur if the server is slow or if the links take too long to load.
   Relies on predefined lists or database configurations, which may require frequent updates to stay accurate.
3. loginAccount.spec.ts
   Purpose: Validates the login functionality.
   Key Tests:
   Ensures the login button is visible on the homepage.
   Verifies that the login button redirects to the login page.
   Checks that the login form fields (email, password) are visible and functional.
   Validates that the user can fill in the login form correctly.
   Limitations:
   The login button click is disabled due to CAPTCHA, so the test does not validate the full login flow (e.g., successful login or error handling).
   Tradeoffs Made While Creating the Test Specifications
   CAPTCHA Handling:

Tradeoff: CAPTCHA validation is not automated due to its complexity and reliance on third-party services.
Impact: Tests for registration and login flows are incomplete, as they cannot verify the final steps (e.g., successful account creation or login).
Reasoning: Automating CAPTCHA would require additional tools or bypass mechanisms, which may not align with ethical testing practices.
Timeout Configuration:

Tradeoff: Timeouts for page loads and responses are set to reasonable defaults (e.g., 5-10 seconds).
Impact: Tests may fail if the server is slow or if the network connection is unstable.
Reasoning: Increasing timeouts excessively would make tests slower and less efficient.
Dynamic vs. Static Validation:

Tradeoff: Footer link validation uses both dynamic (database-driven) and static (predefined list) approaches.
Impact: Dynamic validation ensures accuracy but requires database access, while static validation is faster but may become outdated.
Reasoning: Combining both approaches provides flexibility and balances accuracy with performance.
Soft Assertions:

Tradeoff: Soft assertions (expect.soft) are used to continue test execution even if some checks fail.
Impact: Allows for comprehensive reporting but may mask critical issues if not reviewed carefully.
Reasoning: Soft assertions are useful for UI tests where multiple elements are validated in a single test.
Visual Validation:

Tradeoff: Screenshots are captured for specific elements (e.g., terms and conditions checkbox) instead of full-page screenshots.
Impact: Reduces storage requirements but may miss visual issues outside the captured area.
Reasoning: Element-specific screenshots are sufficient for targeted validation.
Parallel Execution:

Tradeoff: Tests are designed to run in parallel but may share resources (e.g., the same page object), leading to potential conflicts.
Impact: Parallel execution improves speed but requires careful isolation of test data and resources.
Reasoning: Parallel execution is necessary for faster feedback in CI/CD pipelines.

### Detailed Results

1. **createAccount.spec.ts**

   - Total Tests: 9
   - Passed: 9
   - Failed: 0
   - Notes:
     - The "Register" button click test is disabled due to CAPTCHA.

2. **footerLinkCheck.spec.ts**

   - Passed: 9
   - Failed: 0
   - Notes:
     - The login flow test is incomplete due to CAPTCHA restrictions.

## Test Results by Browser

### Summary

- **Total Tests Executed**: 30 (10 per browser)
- **Passed**: 22
- **Failed**: 8
- **Skipped**: 0

### Results by Browser

1. **Chromium**

   - Total Tests: 10
   - Passed: 8
   - Failed: 2
   - Notes:
     - The tests failed because some links in the footer columns either do not exist or the connection failed, causing the server to return an error.

2. **Firefox**

   - Total Tests: 10
   - Passed: 8
   - Failed: 2
   - Notes:
     - The tests failed because some links in the footer columns either do not exist or the connection failed, causing the server to return an error.

3. **WebKit**
   - Total Tests: 10
   - Passed: 6
   - Failed: 4
   - Notes:
     - Some tests failed due to a compatibility issue with WebKit.
     - The tests failed because some links in the footer columns either do not exist or the connection failed, causing the server to return an error.

### Observations

- Most failures are consistent across browsers, indicating potential server-side or test configuration issues.
- WebKit-specific failures may require further investigation for compatibility.
- A more robust solution should be implemented for validating external links in the FooterLinkCheck test to ensure reliability and accuracy.
